Write a header file with one function for a C language tutor (have no includes in your .h file).
When your function is called, print left justified except syntax and code (5 spaces indented). 
Use the format below: 3*, name, 3*; a blank line; a definition and usage; blank line, …
(replace the “<..content..>” with your text;  indents are with 5 spaces),  
***  <command/construct name>  ***
	
<give a definition of the command or construct>
<and say what it is used for and how it related to other items in the menu>  

The syntax of <command name> is
<the syntax>            (use <…> where user gives the name)

Do you want to see examples (type y for yes)? 
Use getchar(), and if the user types y or Y, show some examples (simple to complex), and if they type any thing else, the function is done.
Indent by 5 spaces the syntax and code examples. For the examples, have
***  <command name> Examples  ***

Here are some examples of <command name>:
<give example code – simple first>
<explain what it does>
<more complex example code>
<explain what it does;  and so on>

My main will print at the end of your stuff:     Press any key to go to the menu.  
The function has no input values and no return values. My main will take care of reading other input to continue in the tutor.
The name of the function MUST be the name used below.  The name of the header file MUST be the one in parentheses.

You will need to write a main with includes stdio.h, conio.h, & your files to test your functions.
