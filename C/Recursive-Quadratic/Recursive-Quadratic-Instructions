Write a C program that finds the value of a specific quadratic function 
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
where you pick a, b and c (before you program) to be non-zero integers.

In the program, find the value of your function in the regular way and
using a recursive function call.  
Ask the user for a positive integer value (for x; while loop!), and 
print out the two results.
Ask the user to run again or not. (in a while loop!)
