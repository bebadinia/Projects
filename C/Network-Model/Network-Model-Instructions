Create a network that models something with at least 6 objects/nodes.
Have two types of connections for each object with at least one connection from each object.
Have at least one cycle/loop in the graph of the objects.
Have a ‘name of the node’ field and one other field that is a characteristic of the item.
Create the network and then print out each object one at a time showing the things one level deep connected to it.

Have a function to create the network that calls a function to populate a node (send in the node address, name, characteristic value,
and addresses (some will be NULL) to the connections), and a function that prints out the information at a node.    
Allow an input to the .exe of “debug” at the run command to print out debugging statements – add extra prints in your code to include the address of each node at least,
plus other statements that might interest a programmer.
Make a global enumerated variable that is one of two values for the debug mode (or not the debug mode).
