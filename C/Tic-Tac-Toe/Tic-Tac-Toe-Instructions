Write a C program that lets two people play tic-tac-toe.
Use a global array:  char ttt [3][3];
to represent the board state, and globals for the player (a char to hold ‘X’ or ‘O’ or whatever 2 characters you want), 
i and j integers for indexes, and an integer to count the number of moves completed.  

Assume there are two human players.
Show the game board for each move with a key for the user to type one character or digit to say what spot to take in the board.
At the end of a game, say who won or that it is a tie. Use whatever characters you want for the board lines between the cells. 
Have at least the functions to print the board, get a valid move, and check for a win;
do use printf, scanf, if-else, switch [to find indexes into ttt], while, for.
