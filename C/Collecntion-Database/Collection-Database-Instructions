Write a C program that asks the user for information about a particular collection of things that they own (for example: CDs, clothes, books, videos).
For each item in the collection, ask for the name of the  item, one other characteristics of the item, and the money value of the item.  
Store the information in a linked list of structures using the structure below (replace the xxx’s with the name of your structure; replace yyy and zzz too).
After getting all the data in the linked list, print out the information in a table format.
At the end, print the total number of items and the sum of the values of the items. 
Be sure to give the user specific instructions.  Ask the user to type in items until they type “done” or “DONE” or “Done”.
