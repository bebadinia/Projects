Write a C program that translates English sentences into Pig Latin
Accept sentences/lines one at a time until the user types "stop" for the input sentence.
You can assume only letters appear that are either upper or lower case, there is no punctuation,
and there are less than 80 characters in a sentence (write these assumptions in the user directions).  
Put the definition of Pig Latin in the header comment.   

In Pig Latin, each word is altered by the front consonants (any letters not a,e,i,o,u) being moved to the end and followed by "ay",
and words that start with vowels or are all consonants have "way" added to the end.
You can assume y is a consonant for this project.
For example “Do you speak pig latin” would translate to “oDay ouyay eakspay igpay atinlay”.
Use printf, gets, if-else, for, while, strcpy, strcmp, strlen, strtok and functions (at least a ‘translate a word’).
No global variables.
