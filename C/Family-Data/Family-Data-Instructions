Write a C program that assigns family information to structures:  
	struct family      {
				char name [50]; 		/* person's name */
				char street [50]; 		/* street address */ 
				char csz [50];		/* city, state, zip */
				char relation [50];		/* relation to you */
				char birthday [30];		/* mm-dd-yyyy */
			         };
	struct family people[7];
or more if you have more immediate family members.
Have 7 members at least (include yourself; make someone up if you have to).
In one loop, read in the data from the file   familyin.txt   
Create it in notepad to look like:
	Joe B. Redfield
	6220 Culebra
	San Antonio, TX 78228
	husband
	10-03-1956		 
	Neil M. Redfield		(â€¦ and so on, 5 lines for each family member)
In ANOTHER LOOP, output for each person the following information to the screen and to the file   familyout.txt   formatted as below:
	Joe B. Redfield				Relation:   self
	6220 Culebra				Birthday:   October 3, 1956
	San Antonio, TX 78228			Age:   49
