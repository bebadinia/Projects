Write a C program that asks the user for 7 numbers (positive integers) from 1 to 50.
Generate 7 random numbers from 1 to 50 (hint: use srand(time(NULL)) and rand(), and (x%50)+1).
Make a function called bubble that sorts a list of 7 numbers using the bubble sort algorithm (call bubble twice).
Print out the users guess in the order given by the user and in numeric order. 
Print out the random numbers you generated in the order that you generated them and in numeric order (remember, both sets of numbers must be unique numbers).
Let the user know how many and which numbers matched your lottery numbers.  
Be sure to give the user specific instructions.
