Write a C program called transpose.c that reads in 
15-20 family and friends (one first and last name on a line)
from the file names.txt.

Put the names into the array
char names [20] [60];
(make sure the names are less than 59 characters each).
Write the names out to the screen and to a file called 
trans.txt so the names can be read down instead of across 
and add a couple of spaces between each character across.
